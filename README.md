Snake
=====

Old school snake with beautiful, modern graphics.  

Forked from [neyre/Snake](https://github.com/neyre/Snake). Original version is available on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nickeyre.snake).

Control the snake as it picks up food but don't hit anything! This snake has multiple view modes which fit in beautifully with the Holo theme on Android Ice Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean phones and tablets.

This game has multiple control modes and is the only app around with intuitive "snake-oriented" controls. Instead of a four directional arrow pad, simply turn the snake left or right to adjust its course.  A four directional arrow pad is also available.

The app is simple and responsive with no unnecessary permissions requested. The app follows the Android styling guidelines and is overall very nice to the eye. The graphics automatically scale to fit screens of any size, phone or tablet.
